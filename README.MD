# DSA Grind 💪

Just a guy trying not to suck at algorithms. This is my personal journey through the pain and occasional triumph of solving DSA problems.

## What's This?

I'm grinding through problems from:

- **GeeksForGeeks** - Because apparently I need more practice
- **LeetCode** - The classic way to feel inadequate
- **HackerRank** - More problems, more fun (more tears)
- **Codeforces** - When I'm feeling particularly brave

The goal? Get better. Maybe land a decent job. Definitely become less terrible at this stuff.

## File Names (Because Organization Matters)

Every solution follows this pattern:

```
PlatformName_Question_Title.py
```

Examples:

- `GeeksForGeeks_Union_Of_Array_With_Duplicates.py`
- `LeetCode_Two_Sum.py` (if I ever get to it)
- `HackerRank_Array_Manipulation.py`
- `Codeforces_Beautiful_Matrix.py`

## What's Inside Each Solution?

Each file tracks my struggle with these stats:

- **time_spent** - How long I stared at my screen
- **difficulty** - What the problem claims vs what I experienced
- **topic** - What topics i `think` the problem covers
- **problem_link** - a link to the problem
- **tries** - How many times I failed before getting it right (no shame)
- **NOTES** - the struggles, tortures and pains i had to go through to solve a problem

Real talk: These numbers don't lie. Some "easy" problems took me way longer than I'd like to admit.

## The Setup

**What I'm using:**

- Python (mostly, because life's too short for C++ pointers right now)
- VS Code (the only IDE I can actually configure)
- [Competitive Companion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jmerle.competitive-companion) - This extension is a lifesaver

**How to use this repo:**

1. Install Python (3.7+), VS Code, and the Competitive Companion extension
2. Grab the [Competitive Companion browser extension](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion)
3. Click the extension icon on any problem and boom - it's in your IDE
4. Hit run in VS Code using the extension (no terminal gymnastics needed)

**The test case situation:**

- Competitive platforms (Codeforces) parse test cases automatically
- For non-competitive sites (GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode, HackerRank), I wrote custom test cases
- Either way, when you open a problem with the extension, tests just show up ready to run

## Current Stats

| Platform      | Problems Solved | Ego Status  |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| GeeksForGeeks | 1               | Fragile     |
| LeetCode      | 0               | Nonexistent |
| HackerRank    | 0               | TBD         |
| Codeforces    | 0               | Wishful     |

_These numbers will (hopefully) go up..._

## The Brutal Truth

- Most solutions are in Python
- Some might be in other languages if I'm feeling adventurous
- Comments explain my thought process (and mistakes)
- Time/space complexity noted when I actually understand it
- Some solutions are elegant, others... work

This is my personal learning journey, but if you spot something horrifically wrong or have a better approach, feel free to open an issue or PR. I'm here to learn, not to be right.
