# dsa grind 💪

documenting my journey from  
**“what’s a linked list?”**  
to **“okay… i won’t embarrass myself in interviews today.”**

this repo exists because:

- vibes don’t pass interviews
- “i’ll figure it out on the job” apparently isn’t a strategy
- muscle memory doesn’t build itself

so yeah. we grind.

---

## the mission

solve problems.  
understand _why_ they work.  
get better over time.  
land a job.  
stop being terrible at this.

**preferably in that order.**

---

## where the pain happens

**current platforms:**

- **geeksforgeeks** — my current home base (warming up here)
- **leetcode** — the final boss (loading…)
- **hackerrank** — when i need variety
- **codeforces** — when i’m feeling brave (or reckless)

no platform loyalty. only progress.

## how i organize the chaos

### file naming

```
PlatformName_Question_Title.py
```

examples:

- `GeeksForGeeks_Union_Of_Array_With_Duplicates.py`
- `LeetCode_Two_Sum.py` (soon™)
- `HackerRank_Array_Manipulation.py`

simple. searchable. future-me friendly.  
no cryptic abbreviations i’ll forget in two weeks.

---

### inside each file

every solution starts with honest documentation:

```
time_spent: 2 minutes (or 2 hours — both count)
difficulty: easy (allegedly)
topic: arrays, hashing, whatever torture device this is
problem_link: [the crime scene]
tries: 1 (Ls are tracked too, no shame)

notes:
my unfiltered thought process —
dead ends, breakthroughs, “wait… what?” moments

time_complexity: O(n) hopefully, not O(n³)
space_complexity: how much memory i’m burning

edge_cases_tested:
- empty inputs
- duplicates
- the obvious thing i somehow missed

learned:
what actually stuck after solving it

alternatives:
other approaches, when they exist
```

no corporate speak.  
no fake motivation.  
just what worked, what didn’t, and how long i stared at my screen.

---

## the setup

**what i’m running:**

- python — because life is hard enough
- vs code — the only editor i can configure without crying
- competitive companion — actual cheat code

### quick start

1. install python 3.7+
2. install vs code
3. install competitive companion (vs code extension)
4. install the browser extension
5. click the extension on any problem
6. it opens in vs code → hit run → dopamine

**about test cases:**

- competitive platforms (codeforces): auto-parsed
- non-competitive (gfg, leetcode): custom tests i wrote
- either way, i click run. things happen. life is good.

## current stats (subject to emotional stability)
| platform      | solved | vibe check |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| geeksforgeeks | 3      | warming up |
| leetcode     | 0      | scared     |
| hackerrank   | 0      | tbd        |
| codeforces   | 0      | lol        |

## the honest truth

- most solutions are in python (other languages when i’m feeling spicy)
- some code is clean, some just… works
- failures are documented — they teach the most
- time/space complexity when i actually understand it (working on that)
- lots of comments because future me will be confused
- explanations are written so i can say them out loud in interviews

---

## wanna help?

this is my personal learning journey, but if you:

- spot something painfully wrong
- know a cleaner approach
- want to share an “aha!” moment

open an issue or a PR.  
i’m here to learn, not to be right.

_if you’re reading this, you’re probably grinding too._  
_we’ll figure it out. eventually._

_ps: that “sigh…” in my code comments? yeah. that’s real._
