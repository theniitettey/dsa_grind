# dsa grind 💪

just documenting my journey from "what's a linked list?" to hopefully not embarrassing myself in technical interviews.

## the mission

grinding through problems because apparently "i'll figure it out on the job" isn't a valid interview strategy.

**current platforms:**

- **geeksforgeeks** - my current home (2 problems and counting)
- **leetcode** - the final boss (coming soon™)
- **hackerrank** - for when i need a change of scenery
- **codeforces** - when i'm feeling brave (or stupid, same thing)

**the goal?** get better. land a job. stop being terrible at this. in that order.

## how i organize this chaos

### file naming

```
PlatformName_Question_Title.py
```

**examples:**

- `GeeksForGeeks_Union_Of_Array_With_Duplicates.py`
- `LeetCode_Two_Sum.py` _(lol not yet)_
- `HackerRank_Array_Manipulation.py`

clean, simple, searchable. no weird abbreviations that i'll forget in 2 weeks.

### inside each file

every solution comes with honest documentation at the top:

```python
"""
time_spent: 2 minutes (or 2 hours, we track both)
difficulty: easy (allegedly)
topic: arrays, hashing, whatever torture device they're using
problem_link: [the crime scene]
tries: 1 (we count the Ls too, no shame)

notes:
my entire unfiltered thought process - the eureka moments,
the dead ends, the "wait what?" realizations, all of it

time_complexity: O(n) hopefully, not O(n³)
space_complexity: how much memory i'm burning

edge_cases_tested:
- empty arrays
- duplicates
- the obvious stuff i initially forgot

learned:
what i actually took away from this mess
"""
```

no corporate speak. no fake motivation. just honest tracking of what worked, what didn't, and how long i stared at my screen.

## the setup

**what i'm running:**

- **python** (mostly, because life's too short for segmentation faults)
- **vs code** (the only ide i can configure without crying)
- **competitive companion** - absolute game changer, seriously

**quick start:**

1. install python 3.7+
2. grab vs code
3. install [competitive companion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jmerle.competitive-companion) in vs code
4. install the [browser extension](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion)
5. click extension icon on any problem → automatically opens in vs code
6. hit run, no terminal gymnastics needed

**about test cases:**

- competitive platforms (codeforces): auto-parsed
- non-competitive (geeksforgeeks, leetcode): custom test cases i wrote
- either way, the extension handles it. just click and run.

## the honest truth

- most solutions are in python (other languages when i'm feeling spicy)
- some code is elegant, some just... works
- i document my failures too - they're the best teachers
- time/space complexity when i actually understand it (working on this)
- lots of comments because future me will have no idea what current me was thinking

## wanna help?

this is my personal learning journey, but if you:

- spot something tragically wrong
- have a cleaner approach
- want to share your own "aha!" moment

feel free to open an issue or pr. i'm here to learn, not to be right.

_if you're reading this, you're probably grinding too. we got this. 🚀_

_ps: that "sigh..." in my code comments? yeah, that's the real mood._
