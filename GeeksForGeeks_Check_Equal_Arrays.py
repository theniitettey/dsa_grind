tries: 1

NOTES:
i thought of sorting both arrays and comparing them but that would take O(n log n) time, too much time in my opinion for this problem
i tried to think of a way to do it without using extra space but i couldn't come up with anything, maybe in the future
so i was like since the question says the arrays are equal if both contain the same set of elementts, arrangements(or permutations) of elements don't matter
i thought of using a dictionary to count the frequency of each element in the first array
then i loop through the second array and decrease the frequency of each element found in the dictionary
if an element is not found in the dictionary, we can return false right away, because that means the arrays are not equal, obviously
then i realized i tried to do it by checking if a frequency becomes zero and trying to return false if an element is found again in the second array 
but a cleaner way is to just delete the element from the dictionary when its frequency becomes zero,
then our first condition will take care of it
finally, with my approach, if the dictionary is empty at the end, that means both arrays are equal, otherwise they are not
so we just return if the dictionary is empty or not
sigh...
