"""
time_spent: 5 minutes (was wondering if frequencies matter)
difficulty: easy
topic: arrays, hashing, dictionaries, sets
problem_link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/array-subset-of-another-array2317/1
tries: 1 (used a similar approach as previous problems)

notes:
so basically we need to find out whether b is a subset of a
but what exactly does that mean?
it means that all elements of b should be present in a
i wanted to make everything a set and use set operations
but i was like this should be in such a way
that it'll work if your preferred language doesn't have set operations
so, i thought how can i check for this
well, i can use a dictionary to store the elements of a with their frequencies
then i can loop through b and check if each element is present in the dictionary
and also there should be enough occurrences of each element in a to cover those in b
for early return false if any element is not found or not enough occurrences
if we finish the loop without returning false,
it means all elements of b are present in a with enough occurrences, 
so we return true
yeah so basically you can use sets too but this is more general
that would've been a_set.issuperset(b_set) in python
or b_set.issubset(a_set) same thing


time_complexity: O(n + m) where n = len(a), m = len(b)
space_complexity: O(n) for the dictionary storage 

edge_cases_tested:
- empty arrays
- b larger than a
- arrays with duplicate elements
- arrays with completely different elements


learned:
- using a dictionary to track presence is more general than set operations
- using dictionaries for prescence is your friend when we care about duplicates
- try to think in a language agnostic way sometimes, infact all the time
- if you understand the logic, implementation in any language is easy
- think agnostically to understand
- then you can decide to use inbuilt features of a language later
- one-pass frequency checking is more efficient than building two dictionaries
- decrementing counts as we go allows for early returns and saves space
